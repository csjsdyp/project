The belief is that high levels of so-called good cholesterol in the blood can reduce the risk of a heart attack.<br>The medical name for "good" cholesterol is high-density lipoprotein, or HDL. Doctors commonly believe it reduces the risk of heart attack by removing fatty deposits that can block the flow of blood in the arteries of the heart.<br>But Dr. Sekar Kathiresan at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston says the effects of high HDL have never been proven. He says the new study that he and other researchers did suggests that HDL cholesterol does not affect the risk of heart attack.<br>一项研究提出了一个关于胆固醇的普遍看法的问题。人们相信血液中高水平的所谓好胆固醇可以降低心脏病发作的风险。<br>"好"胆固醇的医学名称是高密度脂蛋白（HDL）。医生普遍认为，它可以通过清除脂肪沉积来降低心脏病发作的风险，脂肪沉积会阻碍心脏动脉的血液流动。<br>但是波士顿马萨诸塞州总医院的Sekar Kathiresan博士说，高密度脂蛋白的作用还没有被证实。他说，他和其他研究人员所做的新研究表明，高密度脂蛋白胆固醇不影响心脏病发作的风险。<br><br><h4>第二单元</h4>The Catalan Institute of Oncology in Barcelona, Spain has recently presented the results of a new technique for treating lung cancer, one of the most widespread cancers, especially in men.<br>It is ultra-precise radiotherapy, able to target a very high dose of radiation with maximum accuracy even in very small lung tumors, without damaging the surrounding healthy tissues.<br>The main advantage of this technique is that it synchronized with the breath. The lung is normally very difficult to treat with radiotherapy because it moves when breathing.<br>Scientists plan to use this technique in patients who cannot be treated surgically, because of their age or the increased risk caused by other pathologies.<br>The new technique has already been tested in more than 70 patients since 2008 and the results seem encouraging.<br>位于西班牙巴塞罗那的加泰罗尼亚肿瘤研究所最近公布了一项治疗肺癌的新技术的结果，肺癌是最普遍的癌症之一，尤其是男性。<br>它是一种超精密放射疗法，即使在非常小的肺部肿瘤中也能以最大的精确度瞄准非常高剂量的辐射，而不会损害周围的健康组织。<br>这种技术的主要优点是与呼吸同步。肺通常很难用放射治疗，因为它在呼吸时会移动。<br>科学家们计划将这项技术应用于那些由于年龄或其他疾病引起的风险增加而无法接受手术治疗的患者。<br>自2008年以来，这项新技术已经在70多名患者中进行了测试，结果似乎令人鼓舞。<br><br><h4>第三单元</h4>More than a million young children die each year from diarrhea, even though there’s no secret about how to prevent or treat it. Now, public health experts report that the vast majority of those deaths could be prevented using currently available strategies.<br>Friberg is a co-author of a new report based on computer software that projects the impact of increased use of various interventions.<br>"With a conservative level of scale-up of 10 different interventions, we would be able to reduce the number of deaths by about 78 percent, to less than 400,000, compared to the 1.6 million that we’re predicting in about the year 2015 if nothing else changes."<br>The software, called the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) projects the impact of each anti-diarrhea intervention on a country-by-country basis. Some of the simplest and cheapest ones can be extremely effective.<br>每年有超过一百万的儿童死于腹泻，尽管如何预防或治疗腹泻并没有秘密。现在，公共卫生专家报告说，使用目前可用的策略可以预防绝大多数死亡。<br>Friberg是一份基于计算机软件的新报告的合著者，该报告预测了增加使用各种干预措施的影响。<br>"按照10种不同干预措施的保守规模，我们将能够将死亡人数减少约78%，降至40万人以下，而如果其他措施不变，我们预计在2015年左右将有160万人死亡。"<br>这个名为"拯救生命工具"（LiST）的软件对每个国家的抗腹泻干预措施的影响进行了预测。一些最简单、最便宜的方法可能非常有效。<br><br><h4>第四单元</h4>Last week, researchers in the United States reported curing nine adults with sickle cell disease. Ten patients in all were treated in a study with donated bone marrow. The healthy marrow causes new blood cells to form.<br>Sickle cell disease, also called sickle cell anemia, is a genetic condition that deforms red blood cells. They become sticky and harden into the shape of the letter C, like a sickle, a hand tool with a curved blade.<br>The deformed cells block blood vessels and cut off the flow of oxygen to tissue in the body. People with sickle cell disease can suffer severe pain, bacterial infections and the death of tissue.<br>上周，美国的研究人员报告说，他们治愈了9名成人镰状细胞病。在一项研究中，共有10名患者接受了捐献骨髓的治疗。健康的骨髓会形成新的血细胞。<br>镰状细胞病，也称为镰状细胞贫血，是一种使红细胞变形的遗传病。它们变得粘稠，硬化成字母C的形状，像镰刀，一种带有弯曲刀片的手工工具。<br>变形的细胞阻塞血管，切断氧气向体内组织的流动。镰状细胞病患者会遭受剧烈疼痛、细菌感染和组织死亡。<br><br><h4>第五单元</h4>The earliest stages of breast cancer are usually discovered during a mammogram. Right now, the standard treatment when tumors are found is surgery, followed by radiation therapy and then hormone treatment. Some women who have a high risk of getting breast cancer even opt to have mastectomies—the surgical removal of one or both breasts—just to reduce their risk.<br>At Johns Hopkins Cancer Center in Baltimore, one oncologist has been studying a less radical approach.<br>The idea is simple. Give a small concentration of a chemotherapy drug directly through the patient’s nipple and into the milk ducts where cancer cells or even pre-cancerous cells are forming. The entire procedure takes about 30 minutes. In clinical trials, researchers found this technique was more effective and less toxic than the conventional practice of administering chemotherapy through the vein.<br>乳腺癌的早期阶段通常是在乳房X光检查中发现的。目前，发现肿瘤的标准治疗方法是手术，然后是放射治疗，然后是激素治疗。一些有患乳腺癌高风险的女性甚至选择进行乳房切除术——手术切除一个或两个乳房，只是为了降低风险。<br>在巴尔的摩的约翰霍普金斯癌症中心，一位肿瘤学家正在研究一种不太激进的方法。<br>想法很简单。通过病人的乳头直接给予少量的化疗药物，并进入正在形成癌细胞甚至癌前细胞的乳管。整个过程大约需要30分钟。在临床试验中，研究人员发现这种技术比传统的静脉化疗更有效，毒性更小。<br><br><h4>第六单元</h4>When medication isn\'t enough to control symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, deep brain stimulation, or DBS, may be used to ease tremors and other movement difficulties. This surgery implants a neurostimulator in your body — usually around your collarbone. It sends an electrical impulse through a wire that runs under your skin up into your brain. There, electrodes block abnormal electrical signals that cause tremors, rigidity, slow movements and walking problems. Before surgery, doctors will use an MRI to pinpoint exactly where in the brain the electrodes will be placed. Often, patients require electrodes on both sides of their brain; left implants ease symptoms on the right side of the body and right implants ease symptoms on the left side. After a patient recovers from surgery, they go to their doctor to have the stimulators turned on. The level of stimulation is controlled by the doctor. This procedure, called programming, is not invasive.<br>当药物治疗不足以控制帕金森氏症的症状时，可以使用脑深部刺激（DBS）来缓解震颤和其他运动困难。这种手术会在你的身体里植入一个神经刺激器——通常是在锁骨周围。它通过一根在你皮肤下的电线向你的大脑发送电脉冲。在那里，电极阻断了引起震颤、僵硬、动作迟缓和行走问题的异常电信号。手术前，医生们会用核磁共振来精确定位电极在大脑中的位置。通常，患者需要在大脑两侧安装电极；左侧植入物可以缓解身体右侧的症状，右侧植入物可以缓解左侧的症状。当病人从手术中康复后，他们会去看医生打开刺激器。刺激程度由医生控制。这个过程称为编程，不是侵入性的。<br><br><h4>第七单元</h4>People who have chronic kidney failure need dialysis to survive. Unlike the native kidney, dialysis doesn’t provide all the other benefits that are required for health. The implantable bioartificial kidney that we are developing will provide most of the functions of a kidney transplant. This device will be implanted in your body and provide both the toxin removal as well as the biological activity that’s required for health. There is certainly a challenge that we have to overcome. Fundamentally, we have had to wait for the state of argon silicon melt technology to be able to provide as a membrane that is required for our device. The beauty of the silicon melt technology is that we can quench super efficient filters. The filters are so efficient that the device operates on blood pressure alone. The implantable version of our device will be the size of a small coffee cup.<br>患有慢性肾衰竭的人需要透析才能生存。与天然肾脏不同，透析不能提供健康所需的所有其他益处。我们正在开发的植入式生物人工肾将提供肾移植的大部分功能。这个装置将被植入你的身体，提供毒素的清除以及健康所需的生物活性。当然，我们必须克服一个挑战。从根本上说，我们必须等待氩-硅熔融技术的发展，才能为我们的设备提供所需的膜。硅熔体技术的美妙之处在于我们可以淬火超高效过滤器。这种过滤器的效率很高，所以这种装置只能依靠血压来工作。我们的设备的可植入版本将是一个小咖啡杯大小。<br><br><h4>第八单元</h4>"Estriol is a hormone that increases during pregnancy. Researchers gave estriol to six women with early-stage multiple sclerosis and all showed improvement."<br>"What we found was that there was a reduction in the MRI lesions, the inflammatory lesions of the brain went down when they were on treatment, went back up when they were off treatment, and then went back down again when they went back on treatment."<br>"Estriol didn’t help those with more advanced MS. Researchers hope that hormone may eventually be used to delay the progression into that advanced stage. In the meantime, women with MS can always get estriol the natural way, even if it’s only temporary."<br>雌三醇是一种在怀孕期间增加的激素。研究人员给6名患有早期多发性硬化症的女性服用了雌三醇，结果都有所改善。"<br>"我们发现核磁共振的病变减少了，脑部的炎性病变在接受治疗的时候下降了，在停止治疗的时候又上升了，然后在重新接受治疗的时候又下降了。"<br>雌三醇对晚期多发性硬化症患者没有帮助。研究人员希望这种激素最终可以用来延缓进展到晚期。同时，患有多发性硬化症的女性总是可以用自然的方式服用雌三醇，即使只是暂时的<br><br>科室介绍<br>1.Cardiology is a medical specialty dealing with disorders of the heart (specifcally the human heart).
