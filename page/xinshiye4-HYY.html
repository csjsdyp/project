The so-called "mean" by Confucius doesn\'t mean "compromise" but a "moderate" and "just-right" way when understanding and handling objective things. Confucius advocated that this thought should not only be treated as a way to understand and deal with things but also be integrated into one\'s daily conduct to make it a virtue through self-cultivation and training. The Doctrine of the Mean is not only the core of Confucianism but also an important component of traditional Chinese culture. From the time it came into being to the present, it has played an invaluable role in the construction of national spirit, the transmission of national wisdom, and the development of national culture.<br>中庸思想（Doctrine of the Mean）是儒家思想的核心内容。孔子所谓的“中”不是指“折中”，而是指在认识和处理客观事物时的一种“适度”和“恰如其分”的方法。孔子主张不仅要把这种思想作为一种认识和处理事物的方法来看待，而且还应该通过自身修养和锻炼，把它融入自己的日常行为当中，使之成为一种美德。中庸思想是儒家思想的核心，也是中国传统文化的重要组成部分。从它形成到现在，一直为民族精神的构建、民族智慧的传播、民族文化的发展发挥着不可估量的作用。<br><br><h4>Unit 2</h4>The four great classic Chinese novels are Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Outlaws of the Marsh, Journey to the West and A Dream of Red Mansions. All the four novels were written during the period from the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties to the Qing Dynasty. They all reflect various aspects of ancient China, including political and military strife, social conflicts and cultural beliefs. The four novels are of supreme artistic standards, representing the peak of China\'s classic novels. Lots of the characters and scenes in the books are well-known in China and have exerted profound influences on the ideology and values of the entire nation. Highly valuable for the research of China\'s ancient customs, feudal system, and social life, the four classic novels are precious cultural relics of China as well as the human society as a whole.<br>中国的四大名著是指《三国演义》(Romance of the Three Kingdoms)、《水浒传》(Outlaws of the Marsh)、《西游记》(Journey to the West) 和《红楼梦》(A Dream of Red Mansions) 四部著名小说。它们的创作时间均处于元末明初至清代期间，其内容反映了中国古代的政治和军事斗争、社会矛盾、文化信仰等各个方面。四大名著具有很高的艺术水平，代表了中国古典小说的高峰。书中的许多人物和场景在中国家喻户晓，并且已经深深地影响了整个民族的思想观念和价值取向。四本著作在中国古代民俗、封建制度、社会生活等多个领域皆有巨大的研究价值，是中国乃至全人类的宝贵文化遗产。<br><br><h4>Unit 3</h4>In recent years, with the rapid development of Internet technology, the Internet economy has become a hot issue. As represented by the promising E-commerce, the Internet economy has become a strong driving force for the economic development. Our government attaches great importance to developing the Internet economy and proposes the concept of "Internet Plus", aiming to integrate Internet with other industries, such as health care, transportation, education, finance, and public service. This will create great potential and broad prospects for the development of the Internet economy. With the implementation of the "Internet Plus" strategy, the Internet is certain to be integrated with more traditional industries and help build "the upgraded version of the Chinese economy".<br>近年来，随着互联网技术的迅猛发展，互联网经济已成为一个热门话题。以蓬勃发展的电子商务为代表的互联网经济已成为经济发展的重要引擎。我国政府高度重视发展互联网经济，提出了“互联网+”的概念，以推动互联网与医疗、交通、教育、金融、公共服务等领域的结合。这将为互联网经济的发展提供极大的发展潜力和更广阔的发展空间。随着“互联网+”战略的深入实施，互联网必将与更多传统行业进一步融合，助力打造“中国经济升级版”。<br><br><h4>Unit 4</h4>Suzhou gardens are the most outstanding representatives of classical Chinese gardens. Most of them were privately-owned. The gardens first appeared in the Spring and Autumn Period, developed in the Song and Yuan dynasties, and flourished in the Ming and Qing dynasties. By the late Qing Dynasty, Suzhou had got as many as over 170 gardens of diverse styles, winning it the name "The City of Gardens". Now, over 60 gardens are kept in good condition, of which more than 10 are open to the public. The Surging Wave Pavilion, the Lion Grove Garden, the Humble Administrator\'s Garden and the Lingering Garden are called the four most famous gardens in Suzhou, representing the artistic styles of the Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties respectively. Suzhou gardens are assemblies of residences and gardens, which makes them suitable places for living, visiting and appreciating. The architectural principles of the gardens are a demonstration of the lifestyles and social customs of the ancient Chinese people in the south of the Lower Yangtze River. Suzhou gardens are not only a product of Chinese history and culture, but also a carrier of traditional Chinese ideology and culture. In 1997, Suzhou gardens were inscribed on the World Heritage List by UNESCO.<br>苏州园林是中国古典园林最杰出的代表，大部分为私家所有。苏州园林始于春秋，兴于宋元，盛于明清。清末苏州已有各色园林170余处，为其赢得了“园林之城”的称号。现保存完好的园林有60多处，对外开放的有十余处。其中沧浪亭、狮子林、拙政园和留园分别代表着宋、元、明、清四个朝代的艺术风格，被称为“苏州四大名园”。苏州园林宅园合一，可赏，可游，可居，其建筑规制反映了中国古代江南民间的生活方式和礼仪习俗。苏州园林不仅是历史文化的产物，同时也是中国传统思想文化的载体。1997年，苏州园林被联合国教科文组织列入“世界遗产名录”。<br><br><h4>Unit 5</h4>Chinese civilization once had a significant influence on world civilization. With the development of our country\'s economy and the rise of her international status in recent years, Chinese culture, which has a long history, is once again attracting global attention. More and more Chinese cultural elements provide inspiration for and become popular subjects of fashions, literature and movies around the world. This shows that the world needs Chinese culture. It was in this context that China decided to implement the "Culture Exporting" strategy so as to enhance her cultural exchanges with the rest of the world. After several years\' efforts, great achievements have been made in this respect. "Culture Exporting" has greatly promoted the development of our cultural industries. It is becoming an effective approach through which China enhances her national image and comprehensive strength.<br>中华文明曾对世界文明产生过重大影响。近年来，随着我国经济的发展和国际地位的提升，历史悠久的中国文化正引起世界新的关注。越来越多的中国元素为当今世界时尚、文学、影视作品等提供了创作灵感，成为热门题材。这一现象表明，世界需要中国文化。在这种背景下，我国决定实施文化“走出去”的战略，以加强中国与世界其他各国的文化交流。经过数年的努力，这项工程已经取得了很大成绩。文化“走出去”大力推动了我国文化产业的发展，正成为提升我国国家形象和综合实力的有效途径。<br><br><h4>Unit 6</h4>Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) is a non-governmental, non-profit international organization.

It aims to break the urban and rural dual economic structure through making integrated plans for urban and rural development, and through system reform and policy adjustment, so that the urban and rural areas will finally achieve equal policies and realize complementary developing patterns, enabling the rural residents to enjoy the same level of civilization and equal benefits with the urban residents. Urban-rural integration is a significant and profound social reform which enables comprehensive, coordinated and sustainable development of the entire urban-rural economy. Only by enhancing urban-rural integration, and by properly managing urban-rural relationships, increasing urban-rural collaboration, and narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas, can we guarantee that our country realize the blueprint goal of building a well-off society in an all-round way by 2020.<br>城乡一体化是我国现代化和城市化发展的一个新阶段, 是要通过对城乡发展实行统筹规划，并通过体制改革和政策调整，破除城乡二元经济结构，实现城乡在政策上平等，在产业发展模式上互补，让农村居民享受到与城镇居民同样的文明和福利。城乡一体化是一项重大而深刻的社会变革。它使整个城乡经济能够全面、协调、可持续地发展。只有大力推进城乡一体化，妥善处理城乡关系，加强城乡合作，缩小城乡差距，才能确保到2020年我国实现全面建设小康社会的宏伟目标。<br><br><h4>Unit 8</h4>In recent years, the social development and changes in employment situation have put higher requirements on college students. Instead of confining themselves to the knowledge in books, more and more college students are stepping out of the "Ivory Tower" and taking an active part in social practice in their spare time. Through social practice, college students can have a deeper understanding of society, increase their sense of social responsibility, and improve their analytical and problem-solving abilities. Meanwhile, taking part in social practice can also help students recognize their own shortcomings and have a clear idea about where they are to go in the future. All these benefits will help them build up social and work experience, which will lay a solid foundation for them in finding jobs or starting their own businesses in the future.<br>近年来，社会的发展和就业形势的变化对大学生提出了更高的要求。越来越多的大学生不再局限于书本知识的学习，他们开始走出“象牙塔”，利用业余时间积极投身于社会实践活动。通过社会实践活动，大学生可以更多地了解社会，增强社会责任感，提高分析问题和解决问题的能力。同时，参加社会实践活动还可以帮助学生认识到自身的不足，明确未来努力的方向。所有这些都将为他们积累社会阅历和工作经验，为未来的就业或创业打下良好的基础。<br></body></html>
