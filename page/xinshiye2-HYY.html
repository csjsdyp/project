The formation and development of the Chinese calligraphy is closely related to the emergence and evolution of Chinese characters. In this long evolutionary process, Chinese characters have not only played an important role in exchanging ideas and transmitting culture but also developed into a unique art form. Calligraphic works well reflect calligraphers\' personal feelings, knowledge, self-cultivation, personality, and so forth, thus there is an expression that "seeing the calligrapher\'s handwriting is like seeing the person". As one of the treasures of Chinese culture, Chinese calligraphy shines splendidly in the world\'s treasure house of culture and art.<br>中国书法（calligraphy）是一门独特的艺术，是世界上独一无二的艺术瑰宝。中国书法艺术的形成、发展与汉文字的产生与演进存在着密不可分的关系。汉字在漫长的演变发展过程中，一方面起着交流思想、继承文化的重要作用，另一方面它本身又形成了一种独特的艺术。书法能够通过作品把书法家个人的生活感受、学识、修养、个性等折射出来，所以，通常有“字如其人”的说法。中国书法不仅是中华民族的文化瑰宝，而且在世界文化艺术宝库中独放异彩。<br><br><h4>第二单元</h4>In recent years, with the development of Internet technology, the construction of digital education resources of our country has made great achievements. Many universities have set up their own digital learning platforms, and digital teaching is playing an increasingly important role in education. Compared with the traditional way of teaching, the digital way has a lot of advantages. On one hand, digital teaching makes global sharing of teaching resources possible; on the other hand, it expands the learner\'s study time and space to learn, allowing people to get access to the digital virtual schools through the Internet anytime and anywhere. These advantages make it possible for people to shift from one-time learning to lifelong learning.<br>近年来，随着互联网技术的发展，我国的数字化教育资源建设取得了巨大的成就。很多高校建立了自己的数字化学习平台，数字化教学在教育中发挥着越来越大的作用。和传统教学方式相比，数字化教学方式有很大的优势。一方面，数字化教学使教学资源得以全球共享；另一方面，它拓展了学习者的学习时间和空间，人们可以随时随地通过互联网进入数字化的虚拟学校学习。这使得人类从接受一次性教育走向终身学习成为可能。<br><br><h4>第三单元</h4>Filial piety is the basic code of ethics in ancient Chinese society. Chinese people consider filial piety as the essence of a person\'s integrity, family harmony, and the nation\'s well-being. With filial piety being the core of Confucian ethics, it has been the moral standard for the Chinese society to maintain the family relationship for thousands of years. It\'s undoubtedly a traditional Chinese virtue. The culture of filial piety is a complex concept, rich in content and wide in range. It includes not only cultural ideas but also institutional etiquettes. Generally speaking, it refers to the obligation of children to their parents required by the society, including respect, care, support for the elderly and so forth. Filial piety is fundamental to the ancient "Oriental civilization".<br>孝道（filial piety）是中国古代社会的基本道德规范（code of ethics）。中国人把孝视为人格之本、家庭和睦之本、国家安康之本。由于孝道是儒家伦理思想的核心，它成了中国社会千百年来维系家庭关系的道德准则。它毫无疑问是中华民族的一种传统美德。孝道文化是一个复合概念，内容丰富，涉及面广。它既有文化理念，又有制度礼仪（institutional etiquette）。一般来说，它指社会要求子女对父母应尽的义务，包括尊敬、关爱、赡养老人等等。孝道是古老的“东方文明”之根本。<br><br><h4>第四单元</h4>July 7th on the Chinese calendar is Chinese Qixi Festival, the most romantic of all the traditional Chinese holidays. Every year, some big businesses organize various activities, and young people send gifts to their lovers. As a result, the Qixi Festival is considered to be Chinese "Valentine\'s Day". The Qixi Festival is derived from the legend of Cowherd and Weaving Maid. The legend holds that on this particular night every year the Weaving Maid in heaven meets with Cowherd. So, people can see Cowherd and Weaving Maid meeting in the Milky Way on the night of Qixi. On this night, girls would also beg Weaving Maid for some wisdom for a happy marriage. But, with the changing of times, these activities are diminishing. All that remains is the legend of Cowherd and Weaving Maid, a sign of faithful love, continuously circulated among the folk.<br>七夕节（Qixi Festival），是中国传统节日中最具浪漫色彩的一个节日。一些大的商家每年都举办不同的活动，年轻人也送礼物给他们的情人。因此，七夕节被认为是中国的“情人节”（Valentine\'s Day）。七夕节来自牛郎与织女（Cowherd and Weaving Maid）的传说。相传，每年的这个夜晚，天上的织女都会与牛郎相会。所以，在七夕的夜晚，人们可以看到牛郎织女在银河（the Milky Way）相会。姑娘们也会在这一天晚上向天上的织女乞求智慧，以获得美满姻缘。但随着时代的变迁，这些活动正在消失，唯有标志着忠贞爱情的牛郎织女的传说一直流传民间。<br><br><h4>第五单元</h4>The Silk Road is a traffic route in the ancient times connecting China and Eurasia. This trade route focuses on the trade of silk, hence the name "the Silk Road". As an international trade channel and a bridge of cultural exchanges, the Silk Road effectively improved the economic and cultural exchanges and development between the East and the West, exerting a profound impact on the progress of the world civilization. Nowadays, under the new historical circumstances, our country proposes the strategy of "One Belt, One Road" (namely the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-century Maritime Silk Road). The strategy of "One Belt, One Road" focuses on cooperation and mutual benefits, emphasizing mutual benefits, win-win, as well as common development of the related countries. Once proposed, the strategy has received positive responses from the related countries along the road.<br>丝绸之路（Silk Road）是我国古代一条连接中国和欧亚大陆（Eurasia）的交通线路，由于这条商路以丝绸贸易为主，故称“丝绸之路”。作为国际贸易的通道和文化交流的桥梁， 丝绸之路有效地促进了东西方经济文化交流和发展，对世界文明进程有着深远影响。当前，在新的历史条件下，我国提出了“一带一路”倡议（the Belt and Road Initiative）（即“丝绸之路经济带”和“21 世纪海上丝绸之路”）。“一带一路”以合作共赢为核心，强调相关各国的互利共赢和共同发展。这一倡议一经提出即受到沿线各国的积极响应。<br><br><h4>第六单元</h4>National Happiness Index (NHI) is an index that measures how happy people are. It is also a tool that measures the levels of economic development and people\'s livelihood and happiness in a country or region. With the fast growth of Chinese economy, the Chinese government has been paying more and more attention to people\'s living quality and the increase of happiness index. The government stresses improvement of its people\'s livelihood, striving to improve their economic conditions and meet their growing material and cultural needs. Currently, the Chinese government advocates the unleashing of more reform dividends, with the aim of offering more real benefits to its people. All these measures will combine to effectively increase the NHI of our people.<br>国民幸福指数（National Happiness Index，NHI）是衡量人们幸福感的一种指数，也是衡量一个国家或地区经济发展、居民生活与幸福水平的指标工具。随着中国经济的高速增长，中国政府越来越重视人民群众生活质量和幸福指数的提升。政府注重改善民生，努力改善人民群众的经济状况，满足人民群众日益增长的物质文化需求。当前，中国政府提倡释放改革红利，让人民群众得到更多实惠。所有这些都将有效促进我国国民幸福指数不断提升。<br><br><h4>第七单元</h4>China is home to silk, thereby having a variety of arts related to silk, one of which is embroidery. Embroidery, with at least two or three thousand years of history, is one of the Chinese traditional folk arts and crafts. Since most embroiderers are women, it\'s also called "women\'s needlework". Embroidery has been much-loved by the Chinese people. It can be used to beautify clothing and things. For example, clothes, quilts, pillowcases etc. can be embroidered with beautiful designs, or a piece of embroidery can be made for a special ornament. There are four most famous types of embroidery in China: Suxiu from Suzhou, Yuexiu from Guangdong, Xiangxiu from Hunan, and Shuxiu from Sichuan, each having its own style and theme. Among the four, Suzhou embroidery has enjoyed the highest reputation.<br>中国是丝绸的故乡，因而有很多与丝绸相关的艺术，刺绣（embroidery）就是其中的一种。刺绣是中国民间传统手工艺之一，至少有两三千年的历史。从事刺绣的多为女子，因此刺绣又被称为“女红”（women\'s needlework）。刺绣在中国受到了人们广泛的喜爱。刺绣可用来装饰衣物，如在衣服、被子、枕套（pillowcase）等物品上绣上美丽的图案，也可制作成特别的饰品（ornament）。中国有四大名绣：苏州的苏绣、广东的粤绣、湖南的湘绣以及四川的蜀绣。各种绣法不仅风格有差异，主题也各有不同。在这其中，苏州的苏绣最负盛名。<br><br><h4>第八单元</h4>Since the founding of New China, especially since the economic reform and door-opening to the world, the Chinese government has made considerable efforts in eco-environmental protection and achieved effective progress. The government has taken a series of important measures to protect and improve the ecological environment, such as actively promoting key ecological projects, enhancing ecosystem construction and biodiversity conservation, establishing a number of nature reservations, ecological demonstration zones, scenic spots and forest parks. One of the important goals of building a socialist harmonious society is to strengthen ecological protection and construction and to achieve harmony between man and nature.
